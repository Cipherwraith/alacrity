# alacrity### GeneralAlacrity is a write buffer and caching system. It currently provides caching for all commonly seen file types. Files can be cached & retrieved through either a websocket interface, or a RESTful interface. There is currently a PHP driver. Also included are instructions on how to make a driver in your language of choice `alacrity_api.txt`. If you make a driver, please tell us and we can add your driver to the list of drivers.### Drivers##### PHPhttps://github.com/lancelink/Alacrity-PHP-driver### Error codes* `e0001` = "error: file does not exist"* `e0002` = "error: cant decode message"* `e0003` = "error: no data received"* `e0004` = "error: couldnt parse command"
